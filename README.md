# Retail_Sales_Performance_Dataset

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to identify revenue trends, top-performing product categories, and seasonality patterns. The goal was to simulate a real-world
business scenario where leadership needs quick, data-backed answers to questions like:

    -Which products drive the most revenue?
    -When do sales peak during the year?
    -Where should the business focus inventory and marketing efforts?

## Business Problem
Retail companies need to understand what drives revenue so they can:

    -Forecast demand
    -Optimize inventory
    -Improve marketing targeting
    -Reduce lost sales opportunities
This analysis focuses on identifying sales drivers and revenue patterns using transactional data.

## Tools Used:
    -SQL: data aggregation and trend analysis
    -Python: data loading and validation
    -Tableau: dashboard visualization and business storytelling
    -Excel: initial cleaning and structure validation

## Dataset
Retail transactional dataset including:

    -Order dates
    -Product lines / categories
    -Quantity ordered
    -Price per item
    -Total sales revenue

## Data Preparation
Key preparation steps included:

    -Validating data types (dates, numeric revenue fields)
    -Checking for missing or duplicate records
    -Creating calculated revenue fields
    -Standardizing date formatting for time-series analysis

## Key Analysis Performed:

    -Total revenue by product category
    -Monthly revenue trend analysis
    -KPI creation for total revenue performance
    -Category ranking by total sales contribution

## Dashboard Highlights

The final dashboard answers:
      
    -What product categories generate the most revenue?
    -How sales fluctuate month-to-month
    -Where revenue concentration exists
    -Designed for quick executive-level interpretation.

## Key Insights:

    -A small number of product categories generate a large share of total revenue
    -Clear seasonal sales patterns exist across months
    -Revenue concentration suggests opportunities for targeted marketing and inventory planning

## Business Recommendations:

    -Increase inventory planning for top revenue categories
    -Align marketing campaigns with peak seasonal months
    -Monitor lower-performing categories for optimization or phase-out decisions

## What This Project Demonstrates:

    -End-to-end data analysis workflow
    -Translating raw data into business insights
    -Building stakeholder-friendly dashboards
    -Using multiple tools together (SQL + Python + Tableau + Excel)
